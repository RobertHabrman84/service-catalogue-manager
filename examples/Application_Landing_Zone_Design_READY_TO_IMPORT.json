  "description": "This service delivers comprehensive design and documentation for an implementation-ready, application-specific landing zone in public cloud environments (Azure, AWS, GCP). The service provides detailed technical blueprints, architectural diagrams, and specifications that enable organizations to host applications safely and consistently within their established cloud foundation. The comprehensive scope of architectural design translates assessment outcomes and target architecture principles into concrete, actionable designs covering networking, identity and access management, security controls, compute patterns, data layer architecture, DevOps integration, monitoring strategies, and operational aspects. This holistic approach ensures all critical infrastructure components are designed to work together seamlessly while adhering to enterprise standards and compliance requirements.",
  "notes": "This service assumes that an Enterprise-Scale Landing Zone for the organization is already prepared and that basic architecture and design principles for deploying applications in cloud environments are defined within the organization.",
